<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>
	
	<p>
		Implement solutions to four (4) of the following problems (each solution you implement is worth up to 25 
		points, to a maximum of 100 points).
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Test an input string to see if it is a palindrome</b> -- input string will contain only chars and 
			spaces, and will be all lowercase; output should state whether or not the input is a palindrome; 
			use <i>STL queue</i> (push chars in back, pop from front) and <i>STL stack</i> (push chars on top, pop 
			from top) in your solution
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Evaluate a postfix arithmetic expression</b> -- input will be a correct postfix expression; output 
			will be the result of the expression; use <i>STL stack</i> (push/pop values) in your solution
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Simulate a battle between two equally sized "armies"</b> -- input will be the size of the armies (program 
			will populate two <i>STL queues</i> with this number of random int (the "soldiers"), the battle each 
			army one "soldier" at a time (the higher value wins, equal values is a draw)); output will be the number of 
			wins for team one, the number of wins for team two, and the number of draws; use <i>STL queue</i> in your 
			solution
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Implement a configuration file loader</b> -- input will be a text file with key:value pairs in the 
			format <i>string:int</i>; output should be a listing of all key:value pairs read in from the file; use 
			<i>STL map</i> (to store the key:value pairs) in your solution
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Implement a word counter for a file</b> -- input will be a text file (the program will read this text file 
			and add each new word to an <i>STL map</i> (the map will be constructed as word:count), repeated words will 
			not be added to the map, but will instead cause the count of that word to be incremented); output will be a 
			display of the 10 most common (highest count) words in the file; use <i>STL map</i> in your solution
		</li>
	</ol>

<div class="exercise">
<span class="sectiontitle">To do:</span>
	
	<p>
		Submit your C++ source (all of your .h and .cpp files) to me at <i>jboydt@foobt.net</i>. 
		PLEASE BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE STRING 'bcsp11' (WITHOUT THE QUOTES IN YOUR SUBJECT LINE). 
		Please also include the class and project number. An example of a proper 
		subject line is: <b>CSCI 21 Project 8 (bcsp11)</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		In your email, write a short paragraph describing your experience with this exercise. 
		Describe your successes, and any difficulties you had.  I am especially interested in 
		learning what gave you the most trouble, so that we can work on it in lecture/lab.
