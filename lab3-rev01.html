		<i>THIS PROGRAMMING PROJECT IS TO BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED <b>INDIVIDUALLY</b></i>
	</center>
  
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<div class="description">
<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>
	
	<p>
		The purpose of this project is threefold:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>to give you an opportunity to practice using, and hopefully demonstrate your mastery of, arrays</li>
		<li>to introduce you to the concept of unit testing</li>
		<li>to give you a problem that involves reading and then parsing data from a text file</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		For this project you will design and implement a program that receives data and commands read in from 
		a text file. The data will be positive integers, which are to be stored in an array. The commands will include 
		operations such as adding new data, removing data, accessing data, and printing the contents of the array.
	</p>
	<p>
		The array must be a data member of a class that you design and implement to provide all of the following 
		functionality:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			data members: capacity of the array, number of elements currently in the array, a dynamic array of 
			integers, a flag that allows an instance to be set to fixed size or allows for auto-resizing (auto-resized 
			arrays double in capacity on resizing)
		</li>
		<li>
			default capacity of 5 elements, fixed size
		</li>
		<li>
			the ability to create an instance with a specified array capacity, defaults to fixed size
		</li>
		<li>
			the ability to create an instance with a specified array capacity, specified fixed size/auto-resize
		</li>
		<li>
			a function to add new data (data will always be added to the next available "slot" at the end of 
			the array; add data fails if the array is already filled to capacity (fixed size) or causes the array 
			to grow in size (auto-resizing)
		</li>
		<li>
			a function to insert data at a specified index; overwrites any data already present at the index, returns 
			-1 if the index value is invalid
		</li>
		<li>
			a function to retrieve data at a specified index; returns -1 if the index value is invalid
		</li>
		<li>
			a function to "remove" data at a specified index; removal means shifting all values at higher indices 
			in the array down one to fill the "slot" from where the value was removed; returns -1 if the index value 
			is invalid (invalid index here means the index was outside the bounds of the array OR the index value refers 
			to a "slot" that is not being used
		</li>
		<li>
			a function to retrieve the capacity of the array
		</li>
		<li>
			a function to retrieve the number of elements in the array
		</li>
		<li>
			a function to print the capacity, number of elements, and all of the values in the array; this function 
			must NOT use cout -- instead, this function will create a string with the desired output information and 
			return the string to the caller
		</li>
		<li>
			do NOT do any outputs, except for your own debugging work, in your array class
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The input text file will contain the following information: array setup (capacity, fixed size or auto-resize), 
		commands (with data as appropriate). The commands are as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>i VALUE INDEX</b><br />
			('i' is the insert command, VALUE is the value being inserted, INDEX is the index 
			in the array); on success, your program should display "VALUE inserted at index INDEX"; on failure, 
			your program should display "INDEX is an invalid index"
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>g INDEX</b><br />
			('g' is the get command, INDEX is the index in the array from where the data should be gotten); 
			on success, your program should display "value at INDEX: VALUE"; on failure, your program should display 
			"INDEX is an invalid index"
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>a VALUE</b><br />
			('a' is the add command, VALUE is the value to be added at the next available "slot" at the end 
			of the array); on success (fixed size or auto-resizing), your program should display "VALUE added"; 
			on failure (fixed size only), your program should display "array is filled to capacity"; if the array 
			must grow to accommodate the new value (auto-resizing only), your program should display "array resized 
			to new capacity CAPACITY" where CAPACITY is the new capacity
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>r INDEX</b><br />
			('r' is the remove command, INDEX is the index in the array from where the data should be removed); 
			on success, your program should display "value at INDEX removed"; on failure, your program should display 
			"INDEX is an invalid index"
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>c</b><br />
			('c' is the capacity command); your program should display "array capacity is CAPACITY" where CAPACITY 
			is the capacity of the array
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>n</b>
			<br />('n' is the number of elements command); your program should display "array has NUMBER elements" where 
			NUMBER is the number of elements in the array
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>p</b><br />
			('p' is the print command); display the number of elements and the capacity as "NUM_ELEMENTS/CAPACITY", 
			and display the data in the array in a comma-separate list, at most 10 values per line
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The format of the text file will be the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>line #1: array capacity (an int value)</li>
		<li>line #2: fixed size (0) or auto-resize (1)</li>
		<li>lines #3 and on: commands (see sample input file <a href="../files/lab3input.txt">here</a>)</li>
		<li>last line: -1</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The input file will be specified via the <i>argv</i> array. If no input file is specified, your program 
		should default to the file <i>lab3input.txt</i>.
	</p>

<div class="exercise">
<span class="sectiontitle">To do:</span>
	
	<p>
		Submit your C++ source (all of your .h and .cpp files) to me at <i>jboydt@foobt.net</i>. 
		PLEASE BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE STRING 'bcsp11' (WITHOUT THE QUOTES IN YOUR SUBJECT LINE). 
		Please also include the class and project number. An example of a proper 
		subject line is: <b>CSCI 21 Project 3 (bcsp11)</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		In your email, write a short paragraph describing your experience with this exercise. 
		Describe your successes, and any difficulties you had.  I am especially interested in 
		learning what gave you the most trouble, so that we can work on it in lecture/lab.
