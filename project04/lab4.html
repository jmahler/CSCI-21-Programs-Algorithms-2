<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>
	
	<p>
		The purpose of this project is to expose you to some standard sorting algorithms and to introduce you to the 
		concept of operator overloading.
	</p>
	<p>
		For this project you will be updating the work you did on lab 3 to add new features to your array class. For the 
		sorting functions, see pseudocode <a href="../files/sorts">here</a>. The new array class features must include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a bubble sorting function, to sort in ascending order</li>
		<li>a bubble sorting function, to sort in descending order</li>
		<li>an insertion sorting function, in ascending order</li>
		<li>an overloaded operator&lt;&lt; to be used every time a print command is requested by the input file</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Otherwise the program should continue to function just as it did for lab 3. You will need to update other parts of 
		of your program to support the new command described below.
	</p>
	<p>
		The input text file will contain the same commands and format as it did for lab 3, with the following 
		additional command:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>s SORTTYPE [ORDER]</b><br />
			('s' is the sort command, SORTTYPE is the sorting algorithm to use ('B' for bubble, 'I' for insertion), 
			and ORDER (to be used only for bubble sorts) will be ascending or descending ('A' for ascending, 'D' for 
			descending). Insertion sorts will default to ascending order. Your program's output should say "bubble sorting 
			in ascending order" or "bubble sorting in descending order" or "insertion sorting" as appropriate
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The input file will continue to be specified via the <i>argv</i> array. If no input file is specified, your program 
		should default to the file <i>lab4input.txt</i> (sample <a href="../files/lab4input.txt">here</a>).
	</p>

<div class="exercise">
<span class="sectiontitle">To do:</span>
	
	<p>
		Submit your C++ source (all of your .h and .cpp files) to me at <i>jboydt@foobt.net</i>. 
		PLEASE BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE STRING 'bcsp11' (WITHOUT THE QUOTES IN YOUR SUBJECT LINE). 
		Please also include the class and project number. An example of a proper 
		subject line is: <b>CSCI 21 Project 4 (bcsp11)</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		In your email, write a short paragraph describing your experience with this exercise. 
		Describe your successes, and any difficulties you had.  I am especially interested in 
		learning what gave you the most trouble, so that we can work on it in lecture/lab.
	</p>
