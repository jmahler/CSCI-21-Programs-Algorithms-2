<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>
	
	<p>
		The purpose of this project is for you to implement and test the functionality of a binary search tree.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your binary search tree must have the following functions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>constructor -- set root pointer to NULL and node count to zero</li>
		<li>destructor -- should clear all nodes</li>
		<li>clear -- delete all nodes (and their contents if appropriate)</li>
		<li>insert new data -- do not allow duplicates</li>
		<li>remove data -- return true on success, else return false</li>
		<li>find data -- return true on success, else return false</li>
		<li>
			get data -- return pointer to data (return NULL if data not present)
		</li>
		<li>*inorder traversal -- to print data in all nodes</li>
		<li>*reverse inorder traversal -- to print data in all nodes</li>
		<li>*preorder traversal -- to print data in all nodes</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You must also implement a node for your binary search tree -- you may choose to implement your node as a <i>struct</i> 
		or a <i>class</i> You will need to implement <i>const</i> and return-by-reference versions of all of your get functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will also implement an application to test the functionality of your binary search tree. The application 
		will use <i>int</i> as the data type to store in the nodes of your tree. Your application must provide menu options 
		that allow your user to access all of the functions listed above. This includes the constructor and destructor -- let your 
		user select an option to destroy the current tree and create a new one to demonstrate this functionality.
	</p>
	<p>
		EXTRA CHALLENGES for you to consider
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			instead of <i>int</i>, implement a class to represent a single word from a text document; each word instance will 
			have variables to store: the string that is the word, a count of the number of occurrences of the word in a text 
			document, a listing of the line numbers on which the word appears in a text document; to demonstrate functionality, 
			you will implement an application that allows the user to specify a text document for processing -- the application will 
			(1) process the text document and load the binary search tree with information about all of the words (alphabetic characters 
			only, and case-insensitive) and (2) allow the user to view the resultant data (view all words that start with a given 
			letter of the alphabet, search for a specific word, view the ten most common words, view the ten least common words)
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you implement a tree with dynamic word objects, you will need to figure out a way to clean up these objects
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			*traversals -- implement with a function pointer (for a function that returns void and accepts a 
			call-by-reference parameter of the data type being stored in the binary search tree); to demonstrate 
			functionality, the program should call these functions and pass in an appropriate function
		</li>
	</ul>

<div class="exercise">
<span class="sectiontitle">To do:</span>
	
	<p>
		Submit your C++ source (all of your .h and .cpp files) to me at <i>jboydt@foobt.net</i>. 
		PLEASE BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE STRING 'bcsp11' (WITHOUT THE QUOTES IN YOUR SUBJECT LINE). 
		Please also include the class and project number. An example of a proper 
		subject line is: <b>CSCI 21 Project 7 (bcsp11)</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		In your email, write a short paragraph describing your experience with this exercise. 
		Describe your successes, and any difficulties you had.  I am especially interested in 
		learning what gave you the most trouble, so that we can work on it in lecture/lab.
