		<b>csci 21 :: project 5 (due before midnight on Friday, Apr 15)</b><br>
		<i>THIS PROGRAMMING PROJECT IS TO BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED <b>IN TWO (2) PERSON TEAMS</b></i>
	</center>
  
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<div class="description">
<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Sample Windows executable <a href="../files/project5win.exe">here</a></li>
		<li>Sample Mac executable <a href="../files/project5mac">here</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The purpose of this project is to expose you to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), and in 
		particular the C++ STL vector class. You will also use inheritance to create a base class and 
		a set of specialized classes in your data model. Finally, you will have an opportunity to gain 
		new experience using pointers.
	</p>
	<p>
		For this project you will create a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_event_simulation">
		discrete event simulation</a>. Your system will simulate a small fast food restaurant.
	</p>
	<p>
		Following are the particulars of the discrete event simulation you will design and implement:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Clock</b>. The clock in your system will be implemented as a for loop. Each pass of the for loop 
			will represent an increment of one (1) minute. All of the simulated system's events will occur in 
			this for loop.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Waiting line</b>. You will use a C++ STL vector as the waiting line. Newly arriving customers 
			will be placed at the back of the waiting line. When a cashier is available, the customer at the 
			front of the line leaves the waiting line to be served by the cashier.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Customers</b>. Each 'minute' there is a 50% chance that a new customer will arrive. Your system 
			must track several variables for each customer: type, arrival time, time required to serve, departure 
			time. Each order type also has a unique variable, described below. When a new customer arrives, your 
			system will randomly select the type of customer:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>hamburger</i>: time to serve set to random value between 3-5 minutes; these customers can 
					be "wishy washy" about their order -- meaning they change their minds frequently about exactly 
					what it is that they want, and are more likely to change their minds the longer they wait -- so 
					they should have a random service time modifier between 0-5 to represent their lack of 
					decisiveness about their order
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>milkshake</i>: time to serve set to random value between 2-3 minutes; 50% of these customers 
					will give up and depart the waiting line if they have to wait more than 10 minutes
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>platter</i>: time to serve set to random value between 5-7 minutes; 10% of these customers 
					are VIPs and will be moved to the front of the waiting line if they have been waiting for more 
					than 10 minutes
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Cashiers</b>. The number of cashiers will be specified by the user before the simulation begins. 
			Each cashier can serve one customer at a time.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>End of Simulation Reporting</b>. At the end of the simulation, report the following statistics:
			<ul>
				<li>The number of 'minutes' the simulation ran.</li>
				<li>The number of cashiers used.</li>
				<li>The number of customers still in the waiting line.</li>
				<li>The number of milkshake customers who gave up and left.</li>
				<li>The types of customers being served by cashiers when the simulation stopped.</li>
				<li>The number of each type of customer successfully served during the simulation.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Following is how the system should function:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Program start</b>. The user will be asked for, and then will input, 1) the number of minutes to 
			run the simulation (see <b>Clock</b> above) and 2) the number of cashiers (see <b>Cashiers</b> above) 
			to use for the simulation.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Each minute</b>. Each 'minute' of the simulation, your program should:
			<ul>
				<li>
					check for arrivals (50% chance there will be an arrival each minute); if there is a new 
					arrival, randomly generate a customer (50% are hamburgers, 35% are milkshakes, and 15% are 
					platters) and place that customer in the waiting line
				</li>
				<li>
					check each cashier; customers who are ready to depart should do so
				</li>
				<li>
					[+5 point bonus] look through the waiting line and remove any <i>milkshake</i> customers who are giving up
				</li>
				<li>
					[+5 point bonus] look through the waiting line and move any <i>VIP platter</i> customers to the front of the 
					waiting line
				</li>
				<li>
					for each available cashier, remove a customer from the waiting line and place that customer 
					at the cashier for service
					<ul>
						<li>
							update the customer's departure time now (current clock time + customers' service time)
						</li>
						<li>
							if the customer being sent to a cashier is a <i>hamburger</i> customer, then check to see 
							how long this customer has been waiting -- if the customer has been waiting more than 10 
							minutes, apply the "wishy washy" modifier to this customer's service time
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Program end</b>. Report simulation statistics as described above. Allow the user to restart the simulation 
			and enter new parameters (time and number of cashiers) if desired.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Some guidelines for your design:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>you can incorporate your simulation logic into your user interface</li>
		<li>each customer type must be derived from a common base class</li>
		<li>the waiting line/vector must be implemented in its own class</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		NOTE: You will encounter several new techniques in this project, but the project overall is relatively 
		small. You should have plenty of time to both 1) learn the new techniques and 2) implement them in 
		code.
	</p>
	<p>
		NOTE: Your documentation should reflect the contributions of each person in your two person team.
