<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>
	
	<p>
		!! Updated on Tuesday, April 19, at 7:50am. <i>retrieve</i> functions deleted, <i>find</i> functions added. !!
	</p>
	<p>
		The purpose of the project is introduce you to linked lists, iterative versus recursive algorithms, 
		and writing templates in C++. You will complete and submit this project in two parts -- <b>Part 1</b> will 
		be an implementation and test of your doubly-linked list using integers. In <b>Part 2</b> you will 
		convert your doubly-linked list into a template class and then test it using objects.
	</p>
	
	<div id="part1">
		<p><b>Part 1</b> is worth <b>75 points</b>.</p>
		<p>
			Design, implement, and test a doubly-linked list class (and a class for a node for the 
			doubly-linked list) using integers. Your doubly-linked list class should have complete functionality, 
			and should be implemented with iterative solutions. Your doubly-linked list must have the following 
			functions:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>default constructor</li>
			<li>destructor</li>
			<li>get count of nodes</li>
			<li>push front</li>
			<li>push back</li>
			<li>pop front</li>
			<li>pop back</li>
			<li>insert (sorted)</li>
			<li>remove (remove node containing a specified integer)</li>
			<li>find (return true if a specified integer can be found in the list, using an iterative algorithm)</li>
			<li>find (return true if a specified integer can be found in the list, using a recursive algorithm)</li>
			<li>overloaded operator&lt;&lt;</li>
			<li>clear all nodes from the list (using an iterative algorithm)</li>
			<li>clear all nodes from the list (using a recursive algorithm)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For your test, implement a user interface to allow a user to access <b>all</b> of your doubly-linked 
			list functionality, including the iterative/recursive variants of your retrieve and clear functions, and 
			the destructor (this means the doubly-linked list object will have to be dynamic so that you can call 
			<i>delete</i> to demonstrate that it is working).
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="part2">
		<p><b>Part 2</b> is worth <b>25 points</b>.</p>
		<p>
			Convert your doubly-linked list to a template.
		</p>
		<p>
			Design and implement a class called <i>DataThing</i> that has a single data member, of type <i>int</i>, 
			<i>id</i>. <i>DataThing</i> should also have a <i>static</i> data member of type <i>int</i>, <i>setid</i>, 
			that will be used as a means of "automatically" assigning each new <i>DataThing</i> object a unique <i>id</i>. 
			<i>DataThing</i> should have a default constructor, a destructor, sets/gets as needed, and a print function 
			that returns string and will be used to display information about the <i>DataThing</i> to the console.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>DataThing</i> will require at least one (and possibly multiple, depending on how you implemented your 
			doubly-linked list) overloaded comparison operator.
		</p>
		<p>
			For this part, update your user interface to allow your user to choose to work with either integers or with 
			<i>DataThing</i> instances.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="extra">
	<p>The following additions are worth extra credit:</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>
			implement a <i>process</i> function in your doubly-linked list class that takes a function pointer 
			as an argument and applies the function passed to each node in the list [<b>15 points extra credit</b>]
		</li>
		<li>
			implement a copy constructor and overloaded assignment operator for <i>DataThing</i> class
			 [<b>15 points extra credit</b>]
		</li>
		<li>
			convert your <i>DataThing</i> class to an abstract class by making the print function a 
			<i>pure virtual function</i> -- if you do this, derive the following classes:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>StringThing</i>, with a string data member, constructor, overloaded constructor, 
					sets/gets as needed, and an overridden print function
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>IntegerThing</i>, with an int data member, constructor, overloaded constructor, 
					sets/gets as needed, and an overridden print function
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>DoubleThing</i>, with a double data member, constructor, overloaded constructor, 
					sets/gets as needed, and an overridden print function
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>CharThing</i>, with a char data member, constructor, overloaded constructor, 
					sets/gets as needed, and an overridden print function
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>BoolThing</i>, with a bool data member, constructor, overloaded constructor, 
					sets/gets as needed, and an overridden print function
				</li>
			</ul>
			and update your user interface to demonstrate all of the new classes and functionality; do not 
			forget the virtual destructor to enable RTTI [<b>30 points extra credit</b>]
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Submit your C++ source (all of your .h and .cpp files) to me at <i>jboydt@foobt.net</i>. 
		PLEASE BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE STRING 'bcsp11' (WITHOUT THE QUOTES IN YOUR SUBJECT LINE). 
		Please also include the class and project number. An example of a proper
