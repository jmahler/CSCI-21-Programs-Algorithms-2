		<i>THIS PROGRAMMING PROJECT IS TO BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED <b>INDIVIDUALLY</b></i>
	</center>
  
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<div class="description">
<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>
	
	<p>
		The purpose of the project is to introduce you to (1) constructors/overloaded constructors, 
		(2) destructors, and (3) pointers and dynamic memory. You will also be presented with a new 
		parsing problem, and of course you will continue to sharpen your skills in object-oriented 
		design and programming in C++.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this program, you will design and implement a simple "virtual pet" game. Each "virtual pet" 
		will have a name and a hunger level (at level 0 the pet "passes out" and at level 10 the pet 
		is full and will not eat any more). The hunger level of each pet decreases by 1 level every 2 
		minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the start of the game the program will create 3 "virtual pets" for your player to interact with. 
		Each pet will have a name (hard-coded) and a random initial hunger level, between 5-10.
		Your player will have the option to feed each pet individually (i.e., the player must select 
		a specific pet to feed). When a pet "passes out," the player will be prompted to name a 
		new pet, which will take the place of the pet that passes out, and be given a random initial 
		hunger level, again between 5 and 10.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some technical details:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			design and implement a class to model the virtual pets, with the following:
			<ul>
				<li>a default constructor</li>
				<li>at least one overloaded constructor</li>
				<li>
					a destructor that displays a message when it is invoked, such as 
					"Spot has passed out." (Spot being the name of the pet in this example); 
					use the 'cerr' stream for this output
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>you may use the timer code provided by <a href="../files/bttimer">this class</a></li>
		<li>
			design and implement a user interface class, with the following:
			<ul>
				<li>use pointers to allocate/release the three required pet objects</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
 
</div>

<div class="objectiveslist">

		<li>correctly manage dynamically allocated memory</li> 
	</ul>

<div class="exercise">
<span class="sectiontitle">To do:</span>
	
	<p>
		Submit your C++ source (all of your .h and .cpp files) to me at <i>jboydt@foobt.net</i>. 
		PLEASE BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE STRING 'bcsp11' (WITHOUT THE QUOTES IN YOUR SUBJECT LINE). 
		Please also include the class and project number. An example of a proper 
		subject line is: <b>CSCI 21 Project 2 (bcsp11)</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		In your email, write a short paragraph describing your experience with this exercise. 
		Describe your successes, and any difficulties you had.  I am especially interested in 
		learning what gave you the most trouble, so that we can work on it in lecture/lab.
