		<b>csci 21 :: lab 1 (due before midnight on Monday, May 7</b><br>
		<i>THIS PROGRAMMING PROJECT IS TO BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED <b>INDIVIDUALLY</b></i>
	</center>
  
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
<div class="description">
<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>
	
	<p>
		The purpose of the project is to provide you with a introduction/refresher for C++ syntax, introduce 
		you to the CinReader input handler, and have you complete an object-oriented design, and implements a '
		small object-oriented software system.
	</p>
	<p>
		Required program functionality:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			allow the user to enter information that adheres to the following rules:
			<ol>
				<li>integers will be entered in this format: "i 55" (without the quotes)</li>
				<li>strings will be entered in this format: "s hello world" (without the quotes)</li>
				<li>any other "type code" (not i or s) should generate an error message</li>
				<li>do not worry about any other invalid inputs</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			when an integer is entered, use an object of your integer class (see below) to:
			<ol>
				<li>store the integer (strip the i from the input)</li>
				<li>
					via a submenu, allow the user to view the results of the following tests 
					on the integer: is it odd/even, is it prime
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			when a string is entered, use an object of your string class (see below) to:
			<ol>
				<li>store the string (strip the s from the input)</li>
				<li>
					via a submenu, allow the user to: convert the string to all uppercase, 
					convert the string to all lowercase, view a count of the number of characters 
					in the string
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		Classes you will need to design and implement:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a user interface to provide the user with access to all program functionality</li>
		<li>a class to contain integer input and associated functionality</li>
		<li>a class to contain string input and associated functionality</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You will also need a driver.
	</p>

<div class="exercise">
<span class="sectiontitle">To do:</span>
	
	<p>
		Submit your C++ source (all of your .h and .cpp files) to me at <i>jboydt@foobt.net</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In your email, write a short paragraph describing your experience with this exercise. 
		Describe your successes, and any difficulties you had.  I am especially interested in 
		learning what gave you the most trouble, so that we can work on it in lecture/lab.
