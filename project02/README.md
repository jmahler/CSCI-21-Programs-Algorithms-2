CSCI 21 - Programs and Algorithms 2 - Project 2

INTRODUCTON
-----------

This project is a game of virtual pets.
The goal is to keep them fed so they don't starve.

DESIGN
------

The purpose of this project is to continue to learn more about
the basics of object oriented design in C++ [[lab2][lab2]].
Specifically dynamic memory with new, delete.

This implementation is a very basic vanilla version implementing
exactly what is required and no more.
For a more elaborate version see the branch 'master'
on [[Github:Project02][prj2]].
