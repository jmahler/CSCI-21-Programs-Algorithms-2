Some interesting results...

The Big Lebowski has the most occurances of "dude"
I though one of the movies with Keanu Reeves such
as Bill & Teds Excellent Adventer or Point Break would
have been close but they are not.

Aliens, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket had far fewer
cuss words than expected.

For a listing of moview with the most cuss words see:
